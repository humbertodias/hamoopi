## Building the Libretro Core

### Prerequisites

- GCC/G++ compiler
- Allegro 4 development libraries (`liballegro4-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu)
- Make

### Build Instructions

```bash
make -f Makefile.libretro
```

This will produce `hamoopi_libretro.so` (on Linux), `hamoopi_libretro.dylib` (on macOS), or `hamoopi_libretro.dll` (on Windows).

### Platform-Specific Builds

**Linux:**
```bash
make -f Makefile.libretro platform=unix
```

**macOS:**
```bash
make -f Makefile.libretro platform=osx
```

**Windows (MinGW):**
```bash
make -f Makefile.libretro platform=win
```

## Installing the Core

1. Build the core as described above
2. Copy `hamoopi_libretro.so` to your RetroArch cores directory:
   - Linux: `~/.config/retroarch/cores/`
   - Windows: `retroarch/cores/`
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/RetroArch/cores/`
3. Copy `hamoopi_libretro.info` to your RetroArch info directory:
   - Linux: `~/.config/retroarch/info/`
   - Windows: `retroarch/info/`
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/RetroArch/info/`

## Using the Core

1. Launch RetroArch
2. Go to "Load Core" and select "HAMOOPI"
3. Since HAMOOPI doesn't require content files, you can start it directly from "Start Core"
4. Press START to begin
5. Select your character!

## Game Flow

1. **Title Screen** → Press START to continue
2. **Character Selection** → Choose your fighter (4 characters available)
   - Use LEFT/RIGHT to browse characters
   - Press A button to confirm selection
   - Both players must select before continuing
3. **Fight!** → Battle begins when both players are ready
   - **Best of 3 Rounds**: First to win 2 rounds wins the match
   - Round indicators shown at top of screen
   - Health resets between rounds
   - 2-second transition between rounds
4. **Match Winner Screen** → Shows final score, press START to return to character selection

## Characters & Stages

Choose from 4 unique fighters, each with distinct colors and themed stage:
- **FIRE** (Red) - Aggressive fighter
  - Stage: Volcano with lava glow and dark mountains
- **WATER** (Blue) - Balanced fighter
  - Stage: Ocean beach with animated waves
- **EARTH** (Green) - Defensive fighter
  - Stage: Forest with trees and grass details
- **WIND** (Yellow) - Speed fighter
  - Stage: Sky with floating clouds and platforms

Each stage features animated elements and parallax layers for depth!

## Controls

The libretro core maps standard RetroArch controller buttons to HAMOOPI controls:

### Player 1
- **D-Pad**: 
  - Left/Right: Character selection navigation OR Movement in fight
  - Up: Jump (in fight)
- **A Button**: Confirm character selection OR Punch attack (in fight)
- **B Button**: Block/Defend (in fight) - Reduces damage by 80%
- **Start**: Begin game / Continue

### Player 2
- Same layout as Player 1

## Gameplay

- **Title Screen**: Press START to begin
- **Character Select**: Choose from 4 fighters, press A to confirm
- **Fight**: 
  - Move with D-pad
  - Jump with UP
  - Attack with A button
  - **Block with B button** - Hold to defend (reduces damage to 1 HP, but slows movement)
- **Objective**: Reduce opponent's health to zero
- **Winner Screen**: Press START to return to character selection

Each player starts with 100 HP. Land attacks to damage your opponent!

### Blocking Mechanics
- Hold B button to block incoming attacks
- Blocked attacks deal only 1 damage (vs 5 damage unblocked) - 80% damage reduction
- Movement speed reduced to 50% while blocking
- Cannot jump while blocking
- Cannot attack while blocking
- Visual shield indicator appears when blocking

## Development Notes

The current implementation uses simplified sprite rendering (rectangles and circles) with color-coding per character to demonstrate the fighting game mechanics and character selection system. The architecture supports extending to full HAMOOPI character sprites and animations by integrating the original game's asset loading and rendering systems.

## License

The libretro core follows the same GPL v2 license as HAMOOPI.
